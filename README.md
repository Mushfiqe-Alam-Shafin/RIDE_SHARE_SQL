ðŸš– RideShare SQL Analytics Project
ðŸ“Œ Overview

This project simulates a ride-share company database and demonstrates how to analyze it using SQL queries.
The goal is to practice advanced SQL techniques such as JOIN, CASE, LEAD, LAG, RANK, CTE, Subquery, CUME_DIST, PERCENT_RANK, and date functions.

The dataset consists of synthetic CSV files generated with realistic ride-share patterns, which can be imported into SQLite (DB Lite) or any other SQL database.

ðŸ“‚ Dataset Files

The project includes four CSV files:

drivers.csv

driver_id (PK)

name

vehicle_type

rating

city

riders.csv

rider_id (PK)

name

signup_date

city

rides.csv

ride_id (PK)

rider_id (FK)

driver_id (FK)

pickup_time

dropoff_time

pickup_location

dropoff_location

fare

payment_method

payments.csv

payment_id (PK)

ride_id (FK)

amount

payment_date

status (Completed, Pending, Failed)

ðŸŽ¯ SQL Problems Covered

This project explores 10 SQL challenges using the dataset:

JOINs â†’ Rider & Driver details per ride

CASE â†’ Categorize rides based on fare ranges

LEAD â†’ Compare riderâ€™s current and next ride fare

LAG â†’ Compare driverâ€™s current and previous ride fare

RANK â†’ Rank riders by total spending within each city

CTE â†’ Drivers with average fare above overall average

Subquery â†’ Riders spending more than average

CUME_DIST â†’ Distribution of driver ratings

PERCENT_RANK â†’ Percentile ranking of riders by spending

Date Functions â†’ Difference in days between first and last ride

âš¡ Tools Used

SQLite (DB Browser for SQLite / DB Lite) for running queries

Python (pandas, random, datetime) for generating sample CSVs

GitHub for project version control

ðŸš€ How to Use

Clone this repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/rideshare-sql-analytics.git
cd rideshare-sql-analytics


Open DB Browser for SQLite (or your preferred tool).

Import the CSV files into tables (drivers, riders, rides, payments).

Run the SQL queries provided in queries.sql.
